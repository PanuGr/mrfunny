This project contains a series of small javascript applications, mostly calculators.

I've been working with alert/confirm functions, switch functions and array-loops.

The test is written with Mocha. To run it, you need Node.js.

In your terminal, type `npm install` and when the download and installation of Mocha finishes, type `npm test`
